# Our Azure naming recommendations

We have had many heated discussions about Azure naming since its very inception. We believe that a balanced naming convention is the answer.

Firstly, we have a few rules:

- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens where permitted
- Prefix resources with the resource type
- Suffix resource group/container/folder names (more info below)

## Globally unique Azure naming

Azure requires some services to be public and globally unique. These look a bit complicated, but once you see the examples we hope it will all make sense.

Our naming convention concepts:

- Resource / service common name
  - Resource: Things such as App Services, Database Servers, Storage accounts. Where there is no "typical" abbreviation or documented convention, we make our own suggestions. For example, App Service can be abbreviated to app
  - Service Common Name: Items with generally accepted abbreviations. For example, Virtual Network is typically abbreviated to vnet in Azure documentation, where as Virtual Machine is typically abbreviated to VM.
- Project

- Project: Typically used for internal projects. For example, you may have a project with a code such as COG0123.
- Client "Projects" can be similarly named. For example, MSN0123

- Environment / Label
  - Environment: Most companies and agencies have dev and staging environments
  - Label can be a branch name, or a release version
- Container / Folder / Group
  - Resource Group is an example of a container/folder/group
  - App Service Plan is an example a container/folder/group

Our naming conventions are as follows...

### General Services

`<resource/service common name>-<project>-<environment/label>-<organisation>`

### Groups/Containers

`<resource/service common name>-<project/client>-<environment/label>-<organisation>-<container/folder/group>`

## App services - example

`app-<project>-<environment>-<organisation>.azurewebsites.net`

Note: There is a 40 character limit for App Service Plan names.

Parameters

- project: internal-0123
- label: v1-2-3
- organisation: good-names

As you can see the App Service and the App Service Plan appear adjacent in the resource list.

App Service Name  
app-internal-0123-v1-2-3-good-names

App Service Plan  
app-internal-0123-v1-2-3-good-names-asp

Resource Group  
app-internal-0123-v1-2-3-good-names-rg

Public URL  
app-internal-0123-v1-2-3-good-names​.azurewebsites.net

## Database servers - example

Example

`<db-type>-<environment><-pool<number>><organisation>.database.windows.net`

Parameters

- db type: sql
- pool & number: pool01
- organisation: good-names

As you can see, the pool and database server appear adjacent in the resource list.

SQL Server Name  
sql-dev-good-names

Elastic SQL Pool  
sql-dev-pool01-good-names

Resource Group  
sql-dev-good-names-rg

Public URL  
sql-dev-good-names.database.windows.net

## Databases - example

`db-<project>\<purpose>\<environment>`

Example 1  
Parameters

- project: internal
- purpose: umbraco
- environment: staging

Database Name  
`db-internal-0123umbracostaging`

Example 2  
Parameters

- project: internal
- purpose: custom-data
- environment: v5-1-0

Database Name  
`db-internalcustom-datav5-1-0`

## Storage accounts - example

Unfortunately, Azure storage accounts only allow lowercase with no hyphens. Just close our eyes to this :(

`storage<purpose(optional)><organisation>`

Example  
Parameters

- purpose: public (publically accessible)
- organisation: goodnames

Storage Account Name  
`storagepublicgoodnames`

Resource Group  
`storagepublicgoodnames-rg`

Public URL  
`storagepublicgoodnames.core.windows.net`

## Internal infrastructure

These following services do NOT require globally unique Azure naming per se. So we have a slightly different approach. However the concepts are very similar.

Unfortunately, Windows VMs have a character limit, so we recommend to abbreviate the organisation name for all internal resources

We generally use: `<service>-<organisation>-<descriptor><number>`

### Virtual machines \- example

`vm-<organisation>-<os><number>`

Example 1  
Parameters

- organisation: gn
- os: win (Windows)
- number: 01

As you can see, Azure automatically creates a disk, network interface, public IP, network security group, and a vnet. Prefixing the name with "vm" allows all VMs to be ordered in the resource list.

VM Name  
`vm-gn-win01`

Resource Group  
`vm-gn-win01-rg`

DNS  
`vm-gn-win01-<autogenerated number>.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com`

Example 2  
Parameters

- organisation: gn
- os: ubn (Ubuntu)
- number: 01

VM Name  
`vm-gn-ubn01`

Resource Group  
`vm-gn-ubn01-rg`

## Virtual networks - example

For stand-alone networks, NOT directly associated with Virtual Gateways.

`vnet-<organisation>-<environment><number>`

Example  
Parameters

- organisation: gn
- environment: vnet
- number: 01

VNet Name  
`vnet-gn-vnet01`

Resource Group  
`vnet-gn-vnet01-rg`

## Virtual network gateways - example

`vnetg-<organisation>-<environment><number>`

Example  
Parameters

- organisation: gn
- environment: vnet
- number: 01​

VNetGateway Name  
`vnetg-gn-vnetg01`

Public IP  
`vnetg-gn-vnetg01-publicip`

Resource Group  
`vnet-gn-vnet01-rg`

Note: VNet Gateways in Azure require that the Vnet and VnetGateway exist in the same resource group. Since you must create the VNet first, then the VNet Gateway would be added to the VNet's resource group. So as you see the Resource group in this case is actually the resource group of the VNet, and not the VNet Gateway.

## To sum up

As you hopefully can see, these guidelines can allow you to more effectively see and find our resources. The purpose of these naming guidelines is to group our Azure resources together as much as possible.

Another thing to note is character limits. Some items such as App Service Plans have a 40 character limit. In our experience, it's best to keep everything to 40 characters in general, unless you are dealing with Windows Virtual Machines which limit you to 12 characters.
