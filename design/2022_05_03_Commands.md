# RFC: Commands and Actions

**Author:** Thomas Shallenberger

**Date:** 05/03/2022

## Summary

I want to begin adding Commands to be sent and recorded in the Sales Module
to help record Actions that took place, who executed them, and what their payloads/result was.

Additionally, Commands could be used to generate Tasks, which would record the async nature
of a job that was to be performed as a result of the Command.

Events would also be used to record things that actually happened, and needed to be processed.

## Model

1. Commands
   1. userId (null)
      1. Dispatching user
   2. id
      1. UUID
   3. name
      1. String denoting event type (SalesOrder.Placed)
   4. aggregateId
      1. UUID
   5. aggregateType
      1. String denoting aggregate type (SalesOrder, Account, User)
   6. timestamp
      1. DateTime
   7. details
      1. schema (v1, v2)
      2. other
2. Events
   1. id
   2. name
   3. userId
   4. aggregateId
   5. aggregateType
   6. timestamp
   7. details
3. Tasks
