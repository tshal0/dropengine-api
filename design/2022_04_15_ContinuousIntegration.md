# RFC: Continuous Integration vs. Pull Requests

**Author:** Thomas Shallenberger

## Summary

I want to try shifting towards real continuous integration by pushing only to main.

This will force me to do two things:

1. Cover all commits with unit tests
2. Immediately fix any issues caused by a commit that gets pushed out

Ideally, this will also allow future contributors to immediately jump in and start contributing.

This will force me to ramp them up quickly, and also keep us in close contact during development.
